# Cookie Policy

**Effective Date:** March 19, 2025  
**Website:** [https://www.stockq.app](https://www.stockq.app)  
**Operated by:** StockQuest Team

This Cookie Policy explains how StockQuest ("we," "us," "our") uses cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website, mobile application, or services (collectively, the "Services"). It complements our [Privacy Policy](https://www.stockq.app/privacy-policy) and outlines what cookies are, how we use them, and your options for managing them. StockQuest is committed to a privacy-first approach, minimizing data collection and tracking.

## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your device (e.g., computer, smartphone) when you access our Services. They help us recognize your device, maintain functionality, and enhance your experience. Similar technologies, like web beacons, pixels, or local storage, may also be used. This policy covers cookies specifically, though we note where we use local storage instead.

## 2. Types of Cookies We Use

Currently, we use only one type of cookie:

### a. Essential Cookies

- **Purpose:** Necessary for the Services to function properly, specifically for user authentication (e.g., logging in and maintaining your session).
- **Examples:** Authentication cookies managed by the `better-auth` library.
- **Duration:** Session-based (deleted when you close your browser).

#### Note on Future Use

We may integrate PostHog for usage analytics in the future, which could introduce performance/analytics cookies. If this happens, we’ll update this policy and notify you as required.

## 3. How We Use Cookies

We use cookies solely to:

- Ensure secure login and navigation within the Services.
- Maintain your session while simulating portfolio performance or running backtest strategies.

We do not use cookies for tracking, personalization, or advertising. StockQuest is ad-free, and we prioritize your privacy by limiting cookie use to what’s strictly necessary.

## 4. Local Storage (Not Cookies)

For certain features, we use **local storage** (a browser-based technology) instead of cookies to:

- Save your portfolio results and management settings.
- Store theme preferences (e.g., light/dark mode).
- Retain other user-specific configurations.

Local storage data stays on your device and is not sent to our servers unless required for the Services’ functionality (e.g., syncing your portfolio).

## 5. Third-Party Cookies

Currently, we do not use third-party cookies:

- **Yahoo Finance:** Our data provider for stock information does not set cookies through StockQuest.
- **Vercel Analytics:** We use Vercel Analytics, which does not rely on cookies or track individual users.
- **Future Consideration:** If we adopt PostHog for analytics, it may set cookies. We’ll disclose this in an updated policy if implemented.

Third-party services we integrate with may have their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review.

## 6. Your Choices

You can manage cookies via:

- **Browser Settings:** Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. Check your browser’s "Settings" or "Privacy" menu. Note that blocking essential cookies may prevent you from logging in or using the Services.
- **Opt-Out Links:** Not applicable now, but if PostHog is added later, we’ll provide relevant opt-out options.

Since we only use essential cookies, no additional consent is required beyond your use of the Services. Local storage can also be cleared via your browser settings.

## 7. GDPR Compliance (EU Users)

StockQuest operates from France and serves users in the European Union (EU). Under the GDPR, we’re required to inform you about cookies and obtain consent for non-essential ones. As we currently use only essential cookies (necessary for functionality), a cookie consent popup is not legally required. However, if we introduce analytics cookies (e.g., via PostHog) in the future, we’ll implement a consent mechanism to comply with EU law.

## 8. Do Not Track Signals

Some browsers send "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals. Since we don’t track users beyond essential authentication, StockQuest does not need to respond to DNT signals. Your privacy is respected by default.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy if we change our technology (e.g., adding PostHog) or as legal requirements evolve. Updates will be posted here with a revised "Effective Date." Continued use of the Services after changes indicates your acceptance.

## 10. Contact Us

Thank you for using StockQuest, where your privacy comes first!
